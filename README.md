# showkey.el

a copy of showkey.el that's installable via use-package

## About

This is a copy of [showkey](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ShowKey) by Drew Adams.
I put it in its own git repo so that it could be installed via use-package.

## Installation

```elisp
(use-package showkey
  :vc (:url "https://github.com/g-gundam/showkey.el" :branch "main"))
```

This should work in Emacs 30+.
